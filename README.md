# Who am I?

This repo was made for one and only one reason, I want people to know something about me, but limited to what's not needed to be hidden

Name, birth, country, hobbies, knowledge, even an email for contact, but it's an email with my own domain which obviously was made for being public

## Personalia

Name: Lasse Brustad

Home: Norway

Born: 9th of March, 1998

## About me

#### Me as a person

I'm a friendly guy who changes behavior depending on different people. That's simply how I am

Helping people makes me happier, so if I can offer to help people I know, I will do it as far as I have time for it

One of my goals in life is to not put hate on someone, but rather ignore them. That's better for everyone

#### Hobbies

I love tech, both programming, phones, PC hardware, networking, and so on. I would say I'm a tech enthusiast, no doubt

Anyway, other hobbies are driving, friends, juggling, unicycle, strength workout and teaching

#### Teaching

As mentioned as a hobby, I like to teach people

I'm a member of a few developer servers at Discord, some which I'm a mod, some with a helper role, and some without any roles

The reason I like it, it feels good when I've successfully been able to teach someone what they want to learn, not only because they're learning, but I learn too!

## Programming knowledge

I'm self-taught, so I can't simply say I know programming languages well, but based what I'm comfortable with, this some of it!

#### Main knowledge

HTML, CSS, JS/TS and NodeJS

#### Some experience

Java, Dart, Bash (Linux)

#### Little/useless experience

C#, Python, PHP, VBScript, Batch (Windows)

## Contact me?

I don't check my email regulary, so don't expect any answer there if you're contacting me at email!
